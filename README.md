Hi there! 

I'm a Fullstack Software Engineer who is proficient in HTML5, CSS, Ruby, SQL, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Node.js, React/Redux, Mongoose, MongoDB, Express, Socket.io, Webpack, Babel, Google Analytics and more! 

I have experience working with teams utilizing Agile methodologies and Git Workflow.

Currently brushing up on DS&A and learning new technologies though building mini-projects.

When I am not coding, you will most likely find me :
- Making progress at the gym ðŸ’ª
- Discovering new music on Spotify ðŸŽ§
- Playing video games (Smash, anyone?) ðŸ¤“ðŸ•¹
- Having a laugh with friends ðŸ˜„
